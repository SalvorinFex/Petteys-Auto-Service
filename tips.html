				<p><span class="OfferTitle">Buying a more fuel-efficient car</span><br />
					By Lucy Lazarony<br />
					Whether you drive a car, truck, minivan or sports utility vehicle, choosing a more fuel-efficient model can go a long way in cutting your costs. You don't have to go                           hybrid to cash in on the savings, although it certainly helps. Hybrid cars, which combine a gasoline engine with a battery-powered electric motor, suck up less gas and                         spit out less pollution than conventional cars. Hybrid cars are the most fuel-efficient vehicles available today. <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/auto/fuel-efficient/1.asp" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>

					<span class="OfferTitle">Choosing the right truck tires from the factory or retailer</span><br />
					By IntelliChoice<br />
					While much attention is justifiably given to engine, brakes, and suspension when assessing a vehicle's dynamics, the most crucial safety and performance component is the tires. The rubber at all four corners is the only part of the vehicle that touches the ground, with four palm-sized contact patches depended on for traction. All the other components work to maximize their relationship with the tires.<br />

				<p><span class="OfferTitle">Driving Green</span><br />
					Buying green is just the first step in reducing the environmental impacts of automobile use. Your choice of vehicle is most important, but how you drive and how well you maintain your car, van, or light truck will also make a difference.<br />

				<p><span class="OfferTitle">The Pit Stop</span><br />
					The information that follows will help you to improve vehicle safety, longevity and fuel economy, while protecting the environment.<br />
					<br />
					1.  Keep your tires inflated at the correct pressure. Under inflation causes tire wear and wastes fuel.<br />
					<br />
					2.  Do not carry unneeded weight in your vehicle. Excess weight puts a heavier load on the engine, causing greater fuel consumption.</p>
				<p>3.  Accelerate slowly and smoothly. Avoid jackrabbit starts. Get into a higher gear as quickly as possible.</p>
				<p>4. Avoid long engine idling. If you have to wait for a long period of time, it is better to turn off the engine and start again later.</p>
				<p>5. Avoid engine lag or over-revving. Use a gear position suitable for the type of road you’re travelling. </p>
				<p>6. Avoid stop-and-go driving. Stop-and-go driving wastes fuel.</p>
				<p>7. Do not rest your foot on the clutch or brake pedal. This causes needless wear, overheating and poor fuel economy.</p>
				<p>8. Keep all wheels in proper alignment. Improper alignment not only causes faster tire wear but also puts an extra load on the engine.</p>
				<p>9. Keep your vehicle tuned up and in top shape.</p>
				<p>10. Getting more miles from a  gallon of fuel is actually easy. Just take it easy while driving. It will also make your vehicle last longer.</p>
				<p>11.  Take to the shade rather than keep the air conditioner running.</p>
				<p>12.  It is a good idea to do a safety check before starting out on a trip. A visit to your dealer can help ensure safe and pleasant driving the whole summer long.</p>
